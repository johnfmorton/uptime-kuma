# Uptime Kuma for Laravel Forge using Traefik for routing

Uptime Kuma is an easy-to-use self-hosted monitoring tool.

See the [Uptime Kuma GitHub repo](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) for more information on the tool itself.

## About this repo

The docker-compose.yml file in this repo is based on the the [Uptime Kuma Docker Compose example](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml) with a few changes to make it work with Laravel Forge and Traefik.


The rest of this is a WIP.
